  <h1>About The author of "Why play Video Games"</h1>
  <p> I was first introduced to video games through the Nintendo DS. Some of the games i had were Pokemon Platinum, Fossil Fighters and Mario Party DS (add more later on in project). I had played Pokemon Platinum for many hours as it had the highest playtime out of all of my DS games. </p>

<p>My favorite genre of games are RPGs. I more specifically JRPGs because i like anime style. These RPGs offer up a lot of strategy and story telling which is something I value the most out of games. I also enjoy fighting games and Splatoon for the community aspect as well as their music.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite soundtracks from video games originates from Xenoblade Chronicles, Persona and Guilty Gear.
	They all seem to have very unique music. Xenoblade Chronicles seems to have a wide array of genres ranging from rock, opera to rap. Some of the best songs are "Uncontrollable","Mor Ardain-Roaming the Wastes", "Visons of the Future", and "Kaledoscopic Core." The Persona series mostly is represented by Lotus Juice's rap songs and Lyn Inaizumi's pop songs. The vocal songs they created for the Persona series had extremely catchy lyrics. Some songs that come to mind are "Mass Destruction" and "Rivers in the Desert." Guilty Gear as a fighting game has incredible rock music that makes its listeners want to headbang. Daisuke Ishiwatari the composer for the game's music makes sure to have songs with lyrics to tell a story for it's associated character.
</p>
<p>
	With All that said gaming is my favorite form of media to consume. This is because other smaller forms of media such as music makes up a video game.
